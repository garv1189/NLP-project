Features of the Text Summarization Project
1. Text Input Options
Users can choose from multiple input methods:

Text Input: Type or paste the text directly into a text area.
File Upload: Upload a text file (.txt) containing the text to summarize.
URL Input: Enter a URL to fetch the text (note: URL fetching logic can be implemented using libraries like requests and BeautifulSoup).
2. Text Preprocessing
The application automatically cleans the input text by:

Removing extra spaces.
Eliminating special characters.
This ensures that the summarization model receives clean, well-formatted text.

3. Summarization
The application uses advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) models (like BART or T5) to generate concise summaries of the input text. Users can:

View the Summary: The generated summary is displayed prominently on the page.
Download the Summary: Users can download the summary as a text file.
4. Keyword Extraction
The application extracts keywords from the input text using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). Users can:

View Keywords: The extracted keywords are displayed below the summary, providing insights into the main topics covered in the text.
5. Sentiment Analysis
The app analyzes the sentiment of the input text using the TextBlob library, which provides:

Polarity Score: Ranges from -1 (negative) to 1 (positive), indicating the overall sentiment.
Subjectivity Score: Ranges from 0 (objective) to 1 (subjective), indicating how subjective the text is.
6. Evaluation Metrics
Users can provide a reference summary to evaluate the quality of the generated summary:

ROUGE Metrics: The application calculates ROUGE scores (ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L) to measure the overlap between the generated and reference summaries. These scores help assess the quality of summarization.
7. User-Friendly Interface
The Streamlit interface is designed to be clean and intuitive:

Sidebar Navigation: Users can easily switch between input types using the sidebar.
Responsive Layout: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes, making it accessible on various devices.
Interactive Components: Buttons and text areas make the app interactive and engaging.
Conclusion
The Text Summarization Plus project offers a comprehensive tool for summarizing texts while providing
additional insights through keyword extraction and sentiment analysis. The evaluation feature allows
users to assess the quality of the generated summaries against reference texts, making it useful for
both academic and practical applications.

Title: Advances in Renewable Energy Technology

"Recent advancements in renewable energy technology are paving the way for a more sustainable future.
Innovations in solar and wind energy are becoming increasingly cost-effective, making them viable alternatives to fossil fuels.
The cost of solar panels has dropped significantly over the last decade, allowing households and businesses to harness clean energy.
As a result, more people are adopting solar power, which helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on traditional energy sources.
In addition to solar energy, wind power has also seen remarkable growth.
Large wind farms are now generating substantial amounts of electricity, contributing to national grids.
Governments worldwide are recognizing the importance of clean energy initiatives and are investing heavily in research and development.
This transition not only addresses the pressing issue of climate change but also promotes energy independence, job creation, and economic
growth in the renewable energy sector.
As more countries commit to ambitious targets for reducing carbon emissions, the shift
towards renewable energy is gaining momentum, making it a critical component of global efforts to combat climate
change."
